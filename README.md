# IEEE-CIS-Fraud-Detection-EDA-and-Modelling

Overview: The main aim of model would be to improve the efficacy of fraudulent transaction alerts and help businesses reduce their fraud loss and increase revenue. It would also help to improve consumer experience by reducing false positives due to the higher accuracy of fraud detection. 

Approach: In this RScript, I have done some basic expository data analysis (EDA). MICE and SMOTE were used to fill up the NA variables and handle the imbalanced training dataset respectively. Subsequently, XGBoost is chosen for the modelling method as high predictive power after tuning. XGBoost also has a built in Cross-Validation feature, as well as parallel processing.

Iâ€™m relatively new to Machine Learning (ML) and this is the first project that I have ever done for ML. I would like to take this opportunity to thank all my family and friends who have helped and supported me through this journey of learning.
