# IEEE-CIS-Fraud-Detection-EDA-and-Modelling

Overview: The main aim of model hopes to improve the efficacy of fraudulent transaction alerts and help businesses reduce their fraud loss and increase revenue. It would also help to enhance consumer experience by reducing false positives due to the higher accuracy of fraud detection. 

Approach: In this RScript, I have done some basic expository data analysis (EDA). As there are many variable inputs, analysis on the correlation between each variable and the target class was done to filter the more important variables. Balancing of data is done using ROSE sampling, to overcome the problem of class imbalance present in the dataset. Subsequently, XGBoost is chosen for the modelling method as high predictive power after cross validation and tuning. A Train/Evaluation split was done on the training dataset to ensure that the performance of the model, with the evaluation metrics set by Kaggle as the ROC-AUC curve. 

Iâ€™m relatively new to Machine Learning (ML) and this is the first project that I have ever done for ML. I would like to take this opportunity to thank all my family and friends who have helped and supported me through this journey of learning.
